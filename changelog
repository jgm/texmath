texmath (0.8.6.7)

  * TeX reader: treat backslash + newline as like backslash + space.
    Previously this case gave an error.  See jgm/pandoc#3189.

texmath (0.8.6.6)

  * Allow pandoc-types 1.17.*.

texmath (0.8.6.5)

  * Fixed transposition of sub/super on operators (jgm/pandoc#3040).

texmath (0.8.6.4)

  * Support 'equation' environment, without the numbering of course.

texmath (0.8.6.3)

  * Use POST instead of GET for texmath-cgi.

texmath (0.8.6.2)

  * Fixed array alignment issues (jgm/pandoc#2864, jgm/pandoc#2310).
  * Use 1 and 0 for _Hide attributes, rather than on and off.
    Officially it seems that either 1/0 or true/false are wanted.
  * Fixed EUnderOver for omml output.  Previously both the under and
    the over part were being placed under (jgm/pandoc#2775).

texmath (0.8.6.1)

  * OMML writer:  Fixed rendering of roots, so that the degree appears
    in the right place.
  * OMML writer:  Don't include empty rPr elements.

texmath (0.8.6)

  * TeX reader: Support hundreds more math symbols (all of those defined in
    Text.TeXMath.Unicode.ToTeX), including `\nwarrow`, `\swarrow`,
    `\nearrow`, `\searrow` (#90).

texmath (0.8.5.1)

  * OMML writer: Fixed order of elements in nary formulas to conform
    to OMML spec (#88, Niko Weh).  `<e>` must follow the `<sup>` and `<sub>`
    parts of `<nary>`. This fixes rendering issues in LibreOffice
    (though Word copes with the incorrect order).
  * Added Paths_texmath to Other-Modules for texmath executable.

texmath (0.8.5)

  * TeX parser: Support limited styling inside \DeclareMathOperator (#85).
  * TeX reader: Correctly parse \mbox.  Its argument is text mode.
  * Updated mathml tests to use mo for operators.
  * TeX reader: support mathopen, mathclose, mathpunct.
  * MathML writer: render EMathOperator as mo, not mi (#86).
  * MathML: handle leading space in EText (#87).
  * Take --version in executable from cabal metadata.
  * Added Paths_texmath to other-modules.

texmath (0.8.4.2)

  * Fixed overbrace, underbrace (#82).  Previously we were using the wrong
    character: U+FE37 instead of U+23DE.  This didn't work in Word.
  * Support \mathop, \mathrel, \mathbin, \mathord
  * MathML - render Symbol Ord as mi, not mo (#83).
  * Handle align environments with > 2 cells per row (#84).

texmath (0.8.4.1)

  * Added stack install instructions.
  * Fixed bold-italic in OMML (#76).  Previously `\mathbfit` didn't work
    properly in OMML output.
  * Ignore `\nonumber` (#79).
  * Allow styling in `\operatorname` e.g. `\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}` (#80).
  * Fixed bug in `supHide` and `subHide` for OMML.  This  led to little
    empty boxes being displayed in integrals with subscripts but no
    superscripts.  See jgm/pandoc#2571.
  * Implemented `\mod` as a math operator (#81).  This doesn't capture all the
    spacing subtleties of the amsmath version, but should be good enough
    for most purposes.
  * Allow pandoc-types < 1.17.

texmath (0.8.4)

  * Improved symbol spacing in Pandoc output (jgm/pandoc#2261).
    This change avoids putting space around binary symbols that
    come at the beginning or end of a group, or appear on their
    own.  It also avoids spacing on a binary symbol that follows
    a Bin, Op, Rel, Open, or Punct atom, in accord with
    TeXBook Appendix G.  We could go farther towards exactly
    matching the TeXBook rules, but this simple change goes some of
    the way.
  * Added stack.yaml.

texmath (0.8.3)

  * Parse uppercase Greek letters as EIdentifier, not ESymbol Op.
    This fixes handling of things like `$Lambda^1$`, particularly in omml.

texmath (0.8.2.2)

  * Handle `.` after number with no following digits.

texmath (0.8.2.1)

  * Handle bare hyphen in `\text{...}`.  Closes jgm/pandoc#2274.
  * Support `\ltimes` and `\rtimes` in the TeX reader (Arata Mizuki).
  * Slightly more efficient number parser.

texmath (0.8.2)

  * Better handling of decimal points. Decimal points are now parsed
    as parts of numbers, not as separate symbols.  E.g. in MathML they
    now appear in `<mn>` elements.  Closes #74.

texmath (0.8.1)

  * OMML: Don't force everything into Roman font by default.
    This change ensures that variables will be italic by
    default in Word.  See jgm/pandoc#2075.

texmath (0.8.0.2)

  * Fixed typo in `defaultEnv` to include `amssymb` (#68).
  * Moved some lookup tables to C, and disabled aggressive
    profiling defaults, to avoid excessive memory usage in
    compiling with clang (#70).
  * Support `\newcommand*` in `parseMacroDefinition` (jgm/pandoc#2005).
  * Fixed order bug for over/under in OMML reader (#66).
  * Support `\boldsymbol` (#67).

texmath (0.8.0.1)

  * Added network-uri flag. This addresses the split of network
    and network-uri packages.
  * OMML reader: change default accent (Jesse Rosenthal).
    The default had previously been set as accute (possibly as a
    placeholder). It appears to be circumflex/hat instead.

texmath (0.8)

  * Added OMML reader (Jesse Rosenthal).
  * Support latex \substack (#57).
  * Added EBoxed and implemented in readers and writers (#58).
  * Handle latex \genfrac.  Use \genfrac for \brace, \brack,
    etc. when amsmath is available.
  * Improvements in handling of space characters.
  * Use ESpace rather than EText when a mathml mtext just contains
    a space.
  * Use \mspace when needed to get latex spaces with odd sizes, rather
    than finding the closest simple command.
  * Use Rational instead of Double in ESpaced, EScaled.
  * Shared: Export getSpaceWidth, getSpaceChars.
  * Shared: Export fixTree, isEmpty, empty (formerly in MathML reader).

texmath (0.7.0.2)

  * TeX reader:  further improvements in error reporting.
    Instead of reporting line and column, a snippet is printed
    with a caret indicating the position of the error.  Also
    fixed bad position information when control sequences are
    followed by a letter.

texmath (0.7.0.1)

  * TeX reader:

    + Improved error reporting.
    + Optimized parser.
    + Treat `\ ` as ESpaced rather than ESymbol.
    + Internal improvements, including using the parsec3 interface
      instead of the older parsec2 compatibility interface.

  * Added tests for phantom.

texmath (0.7)

  * Changes in Exp type:

    + Removed EUp, EDown, EDownup, EUnary, EBinary.
    + Added EFraction (and FractionType), ESqrt, Eroot, EPhantom.
    + Added boolean "convertible" parameter to EUnder, EOver, EUnderover.
    + Changed parameter of EScaled from String to Double.
    + Changed parameter of ESpace from String to Double.
    + Removed EStretchy.
    + Added EStyled, corresponding to mstyle in mathml, and \mathrm,
      \mathcal, etc. in TeX (which can contain arbitrary math content,
      not just text).
    + Changed the type of EDelimited.  The contents of an EDelimited are
      now either Right Exp or Left String (the latter case represents a
      fence in middle position, e.g. \mid| in LaTeX).

  * Module reorganisation:  the exposed interface has been completely
    changed, and modules for reading MathML and writing TeX math
    have been added:

    + All writers now reside in Text.TeXMath.Writers.
        - Text.TeXMath.MathML -> Text.TeXMath.Writers.MathML.
          toMathML and showExp are removed, writeMathML added.
        - Text.TeXMath.OMML -> Text.TeXMath.Writers.OMML.
          toOMML and showExp removed, writeOMML added.
        - Text.TeXMath.Pandoc -> Text.TeXMath.Writers.Pandoc.
          toPandoc removed, writePandoc added.
        - New module Text.TeXMath.Writers.TeX, exporting writeTeX,
          writeTeXWith, addLaTeXEnvironment (the latter giving control
          over which packages are assumed to be available).

    + All readers now reside in Text.TeXMath.Readers.
        - Text.TeXMath.MathMLParser -> Text.TeXMath.Readers.MathML,
	  exporting readMathML.
        - Text.TeXMath.Readers.TeX nows exports readTeX rather than
          parseFormula.

    + New modules for unicode conversion: Text.TeXMath.Unicode.ToASCII,
      Text.TeXMath.Unicode.ToTeX, Text.TeXMath.Unicode.ToUnicode.

    + Two MathML specific modules: Text.TeXMath.Readers.MathML.EntityMap,
      Text.TeXMath.Readers.MathML.MMLDict.

    + In Text.TeXMath, all the XtoY functions have been removed
      in favour of rexporting raw reader and writer functions. The
      data type Exp is now also exported.

  * Bug fixes and improvements.

    + TeX writer: Properly handle accents inside \text{}.
      Use real text environments for EText (\textrm, not \mathrm).
      Improved handling of scalers (\Big etc.).  Use amsmath matrix
      environments when appropriate.  Fixed \varepsilon.
    + MathML writer:  Omit superfluous outer mrows.  Add position
      information to fences.
    + OMML writer:  Handle \phantom.
    + Pandoc writer:  Use unicode characters to support Fraktur and
      other text styles.
    + TeX reader:  Use EUnder/Over for \stackrel, \overset, \underset.
      Improved handling of primes.  Fixed \notin.  Avoid superfluous
      grouping of single elements.  Improved handling of scalers (\Big etc.).
      Handle \choose, \brace, \brack, \bangle (#21).
    + Macros:  Don't raise an error if applying a macro fails to
      resolve to a fixed point; instead, just return the original string.

  * Rewrote test suite as a proper cabal test suite.  Added
    --regenerate-tests and --round-trip options.

  * Updated texmath online demo for bidirectional conversion.

  * Removed cgi and test flags.  Added executable flag to build texmath.

  * Modified texmath so it works like a cgi script when run as
    texmath-cgi (through symlink or renaming).  Removed dependency on
    the cgi package.

texmath (0.6.7)

  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.Unidecode, a module for approximating
    unicode characters in ASCII.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.Shared, a module for shared lookup
    tables between the various readers and writers
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.MathMLParser, exporting readMathML.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.EntityMap, exporting getUnicode,
    a conversion table from MathML entities to unicode characters.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.UnicodeToLaTeX, exporting getLaTeX,
    converting a string of unicode characters to a string of equivalent LaTeX
    commands.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.LaTeX, replacing Text.TeXMath.Parser,
    exporting toTeXMath.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.MMLDict, implements a lookup table from
    operators to their default values as defined by the MML dictionary,
    exporting getOperator.
  * New Module: Text.TeXMath.Compat, maintaining compatibility with
    mtl < 2.2.1.
  * Modified Text.TeXMath to export the primitive readers, as well as
    mathMLTo{Writer} for all writers
  * Modified: Text.TeXMath.Types: added additional record types for
    Text.TeXMath.MMLDict and Text.TeXMath.UnicodeToLaTeX.
    New Exports: Operator(..), Record(..).
  * Modified test suite:  use cabal test, added significant number of tests.
  * Added recognition of the LaTeX command \phantom

texmath (0.6.6.3)

  * Use combining tilde accent for \tilde.  Closes pandoc #1324.

texmath (0.6.6.2)

  * Allow \left to be used with ), ], etc.  Ditto with \right.
    Previously only (, [, etc. were allowed with \left.  Closes pandoc #1319.

texmath (0.6.6.1)

  * Support \multline (previously it was mispelled "multiline")
  * Changed data-files to extra-source-files.

texmath (0.6.6)

  * Insert braces around macro expansions to prevent breakage (#7).
  * Support \operatorname and \DeclareMathOperator (rekka) (#17).
  * Support \providecommand (#15).
  * Fixed spacing bugs in pandoc rendering (#24).
  * Ignore \hline at end of array row instead of failing (#19).
